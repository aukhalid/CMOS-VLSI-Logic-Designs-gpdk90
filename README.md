# CMOS-VLSI-Logic-Designs-gpdk90
A comprehensive collection of CMOS standard cells and digital system designs implemented using the gpdk90 open-source PDK in Cadence Virtuoso. Includes transistor-level schematics, layouts, symbols, and simulations in ADE L with verification against truth tables. Covers both fundamental gates (inverter, NAND, NOR, adders) and advanced circuits.
